So the insert time was signifigantly slower untill it got to smallArray, where is was one microsecond difference.  The final array was where insert was
actully 1 microsecond faster.  The scale of time drops a lot faster for Insert than it did for append it dropped 800 ms the first around, then 8 ms, 
then another 1 ms, and then it droped 5 micorsecond.  where as the append was much more stable decent.
